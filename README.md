## Week 1

1. One command that navigates the filesystem is "cd" which allows you to move from the current directory into another specified directory. One command that can be used to create files is "vim" which brings up a text editor in the terminal that can be used to create files. One command that runs programs is "python" which runs files coded in python with the .py extension.
2. Of the commands used, the "cd" command reminds me of the nested nature of folders on the computer. For example, if folder A contains folder B and folder C contains folder D, and both A and C are themselves contained with a larger folder E, when the user is currently within folder A on the terminal, they can use "cd" to move into folder B but will not be able to move into folder D.
3. I feel like I accomplished the learning objectives of this section. One question I still have is why Bash comes from Bourne Again Shell.


## Week 2

### Context

Quote: "How ‘smart’ is it to let the Internet of Things pervade everything in our lives, without active and purposeful design?" (Sarma)

- In "The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World", Sanjay Sarma discusses both the design achievements and limitations in the development of the internet of things. He describes how the previously unthinkable interconnectedness of modern products leads to both greater value to consumers and growing security concerns. The anonymous author of "The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it's not really yours" expands on these concerns by suggesting that these security flaws are not just resulting from a lack of communication among companies but instead part of a larger system that continually disadvantages consumers. By providing buyers with shiny new features, companies are able to build planned obsolescence and a lack of reliability and support into their products.

- I thought that it was really interesting that when addressing concerns about the future of the Internet of Things, Sarma primarily discussed data security. While data security is extremely important, most issues I've previously heard people address were whether having all of our items connected to the internet is as desirable as we think (i.e. "how ‘smart’ is it to let the Internet of Things pervade everything in our lives"). While these issues are discussed more in the other article, I don't think either really approaches the issue from the perspective of how the internet of things is changing our interactions with technology. 

Question: Doesn't it benefit companies to a certain extent if their IoT devices can't communicate with the IoT devices from other companies?

### Experiments

<!-- List each Platt experiment / Monk recipe outcome, adding notes, photos, schematics, captions to show your work. -->

1. Taste the power!
![IMG_5058](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68158566/153242531-9dea1af9-b2fa-4915-9a98-0d5d434b0925.jpg)
(The setup that I used to shock my tongue. Photo of me being shocked not included.)
In this experiment, I connected two 4.5 V battery packs together and then used them to shock my tongue.

    1. The distance of the prongs on your tongue varies the severity of the shock.
    2. Quiz question: Why isn't there any heat on your tongue when you shock it?
    
2. Let's abuse a battery!
In this experiment, the textbook describes the process of shorting a battery. Instead, in class, we shorted an LED by giving it too much voltage.
    1. It took about 13.5 V (or three 4.5 V battery packs) to short out the LED.
    2. Quiz question: Calculate the resistance of the wires given that the LED causes a voltage drop of 2 V and the amount of current is 0.02 amps.

3. Your first circuit
![IMG_5059](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68158566/153242535-0fff3b7a-ff27-4180-a9d0-a85cdaf07307.jpg)
(My first circuit. Created using a 470 Ohm resistor.)
In this experiment, I created my first circuit using first a 470 Ohm resistor and then a 10k Ohm resistor.
    
    1. When reading the lines on the resistor, the gold or silver lines should be on the right of the resistor. The rest of the lines should be read left to right.
    2. The LED shined significantly brighter with the 470 Ohm resistor than with the 10k Ohm resistor.
    3. Quiz question: Find the resistance of a resistor with red, black, red, and gold lines (from left to right).
    
4. Varying the voltage
![IMG_5060](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68158566/153263289-7e170c50-db3b-42a7-8945-8909bd0ea3d6.jpg)
(A picture of my circuit using a 1k potentiometer and an LED shining as much as it could with 9 V.)
    1. A potentiometer is like a resistor that can vary the amount of resistance it provides to a circuit. A potentiometer contains either a plastic or coiled metal wire. The wiper works by allowing the current to bypass a certain amount of either the plastic or metal coil, providing a shortcut that reduces resistance.
    2. When the wiper was all the way counter-clockwise, the resistance was highest and the LED was completely dark. When the wiper was turned all the way clockwise, the resistance was the lowest and the LED was very bright.
    3. Quiz question: How does the interior of the potentiometer allow for variable resistance?
    
## Week 3
### Context
- In the Critical Engineering Manifesto, Julian Oliver, Gordan Savičić, and Danja Vasiliev lay out proposed solutions to the nearsightedness of tech development, including looking beyond relentless optimism in favor of frankly evaluating the impact on humanity. Julian Oliver further explains some of the rationale behind these solutions in the profile about him. He describes how he deliberately chooses to not rely on software and what led him to getting involved in techonology and art. His decisions are contextualized in All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (Part I) which describes the objectivist frameworks of Silicon Valley's development and how Ayn Rand's writings indirectly led to the collapse of the global financial system during the 2000s.
- I thought it was really interesting how far Oliver was willing to go in order to avoid becoming reliant on technology. I think his point about disabling a lot of the desktop art in order to reduce the amount of branding when he opens up his computer was a cool approach.
- Question: How was the development of Silicon Valley influenced by the objectivist policies of the banking industry?

Additionally, I read Chapter 2 in the Monk book which was about networking. It described how to connect a raspberry pi to other devices such as printers and computers, controlling it via SSH or VNC, and connecting it to the wifi. I also did the tinkercad onboarding tutorials which taught me how to rotate and move the camera as well as place and rotate an object.

## Week 4
### Context
- In Pay for the Printer, Phillip K. Dick describes a future in which humans have become entirely reliant on technology (in the form of a benevolent alien race) that they do not understand. In The Preserving Machines, Dick elaborates on this theme by describing how an effort to save reproductions of sheet music by famous musicians ends with disastrous and unforeseen consequences. In both cases, the theme of the dangers of human dependence is described. In part 2 of All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace, the field of cybernetics is discussed as well as the limits of modeling natural systems.
- I thought it was interesting how both of Dick's works described human creation in terms of survival as well as human creation for its own sake. In Pay for the Printer, Dawes discusses how proud he is of the very basic cup that he carved. In The Preserving Machine, Doc Labyrinth discusses his pride in the sheet music animals created by his machine. It is made clear by both texts that the key to human survival is not Luddism but instead thoughtful creation. Another thought I had was that some aspects of the plot of Pay for the Printer reminded me of WALL-E.
- Question: How were Dick's writings influenced by Cold War era improvements in technology?

### Monk Chapter 3
Chapter 3 describes how to navigate the file system on a Rasberry Pi using the Command Line Interface. It describes how to use commands such as cd (change directory), mv (move), cp (copy), and nano (opens a file editor). It also describes the process of downloading software using sudo apt-get. This chapter was largely review of what we did in the CLI activities.

### Monk Chapter 5
Chapter 5 describes basic Python such as printing, creating variables, performing arithmetic, and doing string operations. It also describes if statements and loops. This chapter was also mostly review.

## Week 5
### Context
- In "Everything That's Inside Your iPhone", Brian Merchant investigates the origins of the iPhone. He finds that the majority of each phone is comprised of a small amount of largely inexpensive metal. However, the human toll of mining the components is high. He travels to Cerro Rico in Bolivia and finds that the conditions in which the tin used for soldering is mined are terrifying and that the mountain is extremely dangerous. He ends by discussing the difficulties behind regulating these industries. In "One Man's Nearly Impossible Quest to Make a Toaster From Scratch", Rachel Swaby describes Thomas Thwaites' Herculaen journey to make his own toaster from raw materials. She relates the difficulties that Thwaites' had in sourcing these raw materials given that they come from all over the world. She then described his process for turing the raw materials into components. This included his attempts to smelt some of the metal as well melt down plastic from around his house. Episode 3 of All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace describes how Bill Hamilton and George Price started thinking about humans as being controlled by our genes in the same way that hardware is controlled by software, the fighting in the Congo for precious materials, and the legacy of colonialism in Rwanda through a discussion of Dian Fossey. Overall, this episode continued with the theme of how technological philosophy expedites the trivialization of human life.
- I understand that most of the global supply chain for producing electronics is a result of where certain metals are found, however, it works out so conveniently for some of these companies that I'm wondering whether some of the difficulty that Thwaites found when trying to source the raw materials and some of the difficulty that Merchant found in regulating these industries aren't just effects of a globalized economy but instead purposeful obfuscation. It directly benefits large tech companies that every component comes from a different country and that each of these countries has different patchwork labor laws.
- Question: As technology gets thinner and smaller over time, will the demand for these raw materials decrease? As labs get better at synthesizing these materials (cutting human miners out of the equation), will that lead to an increased or decreased quality of life for those who depend upon this industry for their income?


### Experiments

6. Very Simple Switching

![IMG_5106](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68158566/156400756-b7d2b985-956a-4438-b9df-2b9e4963b284.jpg)
(Photo of our setup)

In this experiment, we added two switches to our basic LED circuit which we used to turn the LED on and off.
Quiz question: How do switches work?

7. Investigating a Relay

Experiment 7 video: https://youtu.be/NfBcLCm8FXU

In this experiment, we set up a relay that would beep until we pushed down on our button switch.
Quiz question: How is a relay different from a regular switch?

8. A Relay Oscillator
![IMG_5110](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68158566/156410553-34d0dde3-7453-448a-80ce-f262ca94a59e.jpg)
(The setup that we used in class)

In this experiment, we set up a circuit using a breadboard where pressing the button causes one of the LEDs to turn on and the other to turn off.
Quiz question: Why does one of the lights turn off when the button is pressed?

9. Time and Capacitors

In this experiment, we looked at how the resistance changed how fast we were able to charge a capacitor using a battery. The battery charges faster with less resistance, but the change is not linear. I found that it took about two seconds with the lower resistance and about ten seconds with the higher resistance.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68158566/157496073-d55704b1-a0dc-4474-9c0f-5e7b3b5c14d3.MOV

Quiz question: If the resistance used is 10k Ohms, how long would we expect it to take to charge the capacitor to 9V?

10. Transistor Switching
In this experiment, we showed that when charge is applied to the base of an NPN transistor, that charge can control the flow of other charge going through the transistor.

## Week 6

### Context 
- In "Igloo White", John Correll describes the history of the military operation "Igloo White" which was an attempt by the US to create a sensor-based wall between North and South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. These sensors could detect noise, urine, and sweat. It is difficult to determine whether this operation was a success or not. In one notable anecdote, after the US military proudly claimed to have stopped a certain number of trucks from North Vietnam using these sensors, a Vietnamese official responded that this number was significantly higher than the number of trucks in both North and South Vietnam. Despite these mixed results, Igloo White laid the groundwork for both significant progress in sensor development and police surveillance following 9/11. This is the topic discussed in "Unseen Sensors: Constantly Sensing but Rarely Seen" by Mayo Nissen. This article shows many examples of the ways that conditions are monitored in public areas using sensors and raises questions about why and how this tech is implemented.
- Some of the tech in "Unseen Sensors: Constantly Sensing but Rarely Seen" reminds me of a common story from my hometown. I'm from a coastal area of Floria that is decently popular with tourists and spring breakers. There is an extremely wealthy area nearby called Longboat Key. Because there are a limited number of ways on and off of Longboat Key, all of the entrances are heavily monitored. Police scanners scan license tags not just for stolen vehicles, but also for whether or not the owner has a police record. The entire area has extremely intense security that people who live there generally seem to approve of. https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/local/sarasotacounty/are-longboat-key-cameras-an-invasion-of-privacy/67-121490259
- Question: What process exists for registering surveillance/sensor devices? Legally, do you need to report if you are using sensors in a public area? 


### Experiments

11. Light and Sound

In this experiment, we used transistors to create a flashing LED light.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68158566/157498242-02842475-50eb-43c5-94df-288e1e71b87a.MOV


12. Joining Two Wires Together

In this experiment, we learned how to solder two wires together.


13. Roasting an LED

In the same way that's it's possible to burn out an LED using too much current, it's also possible to burn out an LED using heat.


Monk: Chapter 6, Python Lists and Dictionaries
Chapter 6 describes Python list operations such as removing an element from a list, adding an element to a list, etc. It also describes dictionaries which is basically two lists in which values from one list are associated with keys from the other.


## Week 7

## Week 8

### Monk Chapter 11
This chapter describes how to connect a button to a breadboard hooked up to a Raspberry Pi and use it with code to turn an LED on and off. It also describes the process of connecting two-position and center-off toggles where the two-position works similarly to a tactile button and the center-off toggle has three states. This chapter also describes bouncing (which is where the expected action happens twice when a button is pressed) and de-bouncing which is the process by which bouncing is prevented.
