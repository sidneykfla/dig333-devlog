## Week 1

1. One command that navigates the filesystem is "cd" which allows you to move from the current directory into another specified directory. One command that can be used to create files is "vim" which brings up a text editor in the terminal that can be used to create files. One command that runs programs is "python" which runs files coded in python with the .py extension.
2. Of the commands used, the "cd" command reminds me of the nested nature of folders on the computer. For example, if folder A contains folder B and folder C contains folder D, and both A and C are themselves contained with a larger folder E, when the user is currently within folder A on the terminal, they can use "cd" to move into folder B but will not be able to move into folder D.
3. I feel like I accomplished the learning objectives of this section. One question I still have is why Bash comes from Bourne Again Shell.


## Week 2

### Context

Quote: "How ‘smart’ is it to let the Internet of Things pervade everything in our lives, without active and purposeful design?" (Sarma)

- In "The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World", Sanjay Sarma discusses both the design achievements and limitations in the development of the internet of things. He describes how the previously unthinkable interconnectedness of modern products leads to both greater value to consumers and growing security concerns. The anonymous author of "The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it's not really yours" expands on these concerns by suggesting that these security flaws are not just resulting from a lack of communication among companies but instead part of a larger system that continually disadvantages consumers. By providing buyers with shiny new features, companies are able to build planned obsolescence and a lack of reliability and support into their products.

- I thought that it was really interesting that when addressing concerns about the future of the Internet of Things, Sarma primarily discussed data security. While data security is extremely important, most issues I've previously heard people address were whether having all of our items connected to the internet is as desirable as we think (i.e. "how ‘smart’ is it to let the Internet of Things pervade everything in our lives"). While these issues are discussed more in the other article, I don't think either really approaches the issue from the perspective of how the internet of things is changing our interactions with technology. 

Question: Doesn't it benefit companies to a certain extent if their IoT devices can't communicate with the IoT devices from other companies?

### Experiments

<!-- List each Platt experiment / Monk recipe outcome, adding notes, photos, schematics, captions to show your work. -->

1. Taste the power!
![IMG_5058](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68158566/153242531-9dea1af9-b2fa-4915-9a98-0d5d434b0925.jpg)
(The setup that I used to shock my tongue. Photo of me being shocked not included.)
In this experiment, I connected two 4.5 V battery packs together and then used them to shock my tongue.

    1. The distance of the prongs on your tongue varies the severity of the shock.
    2. Quiz question: Why isn't there any heat on your tongue when you shock it?
    
2. Let's abuse a battery!
In this experiment, the textbook describes the process of shorting a battery. Instead, in class, we shorted an LED by giving it too much voltage.
    1. It took about 13.5 V (or three 4.5 V battery packs) to short out the LED.
    2. Quiz question: Calculate the resistance of the wires given that the LED causes a voltage drop of 2 V and the amount of current is 0.02 amps.

3. Your first circuit
![IMG_5059](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68158566/153242535-0fff3b7a-ff27-4180-a9d0-a85cdaf07307.jpg)
(My first circuit. Created using a 470 Ohm resistor.)
In this experiment, I created my first circuit using first a 470 Ohm resistor and then a 10k Ohm resistor.
    
    1. When reading the lines on the resistor, the gold or silver lines should be on the right of the resistor. The rest of the lines should be read left to right.
    2. The LED shined significantly brighter with the 470 Ohm resistor than with the 10k Ohm resistor.
    3. Quiz question: Find the resistance of a resistor with red, black, red, and gold lines (from left to right).
    
4. Varying the voltage
![IMG_5060](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68158566/153263289-7e170c50-db3b-42a7-8945-8909bd0ea3d6.jpg)
(A picture of my circuit using a 1k potentiometer and an LED shining as much as it could with 9 V.)
    1. A potentiometer is like a resistor that can vary the amount of resistance it provides to a circuit. A potentiometer contains either a plastic or coiled metal wire. The wiper works by allowing the current to bypass a certain amount of either the plastic or metal coil, providing a shortcut that reduces resistance.
    2. When the wiper was all the way counter-clockwise, the resistance was highest and the LED was completely dark. When the wiper was turned all the way clockwise, the resistance was the lowest and the LED was very bright.
    3. Quiz question: How does the interior of the potentiometer allow for variable resistance?
    
## Week 3
### Context
In the Critical Engineering Manifesto, Julian Oliver, Gordan Savičić, and Danja Vasiliev lay out proposed solutions to the nearsightedness of tech development, including looking beyond relentless optimism in favor of frankly evaluating the impact on humanity. Julian Oliver further explains some of the rationale behind these solutions in the profile about him. He describes how he deliberately chooses to not rely on software and what led him to getting involved in techonology and art. His decisions are contextualized in All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (Part I) which describes the objectivist frameworks of Silicon Valley's development and how Ayn Rand's writings indirectly led to the collapse of the global financial system during the 2000s.
